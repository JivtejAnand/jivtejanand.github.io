        <h2>About the project</h2>
        <p>Glucometer's are devices which basically check blood sugar levels by using an invasive method.
          India is often called the 'diabetes capital' of the world and the burden has been skewed towards the urban
          centres.Now, a recent study has shown by how much â€” 26.1 per cent urban respondents aged 55 years or more were
          diagnosed with high blood sugar levels.There are tons of sensor based technology that are being researched and
          developed and majority of them are in the direction on Non-Invasive methods of measuring glucose levels in
          ones blood. Above i have mentioned the 4 most promising tech being developed by more than 40 brands.
          While researching i found out another method which measures the glucose levels in the user via ones breath.
          But no big brand i came across with such technology hence i decided to design a glucometer that would tell us the
          glucose levels via the breath of the user.
          <br>
          <br>
          As an designer i was tasked with creating the concept for a glucometer that would be unique and futuristic.
          Based on the type of grips and how we interact we our everyday products (Smartphones), I chose to go ahead
          with the Power Grip. After deiciding on grip and ergonomics i had a basic frame upon which i could work further.
          Upon which i began to brainstorm and sketch out my ideas and multiple forms for the product and then 
          presented few options to potential user's. From where i got my final form.

        <h2>In Retrospect</h2>
        <p>Biosense Technologies Pvt Ltd, develops diagnostic medical devices. They have developed a QPCR
          machine or a CoVid testing machine which has a 10.4 inch display.
          These machine is used by diagonostic labs and blood banks to do their respective tests. Even though
          the internal system is 100% accurate they still required a Usable and User-Friendly interaction with
          the machine in order to achieve the tasks with ease and accuracy.
          This machine is in high demand due to the current pademic situaton hence it was atmost importance
          for the machine to be extremely user-friendly.
          <br>
          <br>
          As an designer i was tasked with creating the user flow and the visual design of the machine to
          achieve ease of use and accuracy.
          As per the marketing team a single machine was to cater to two different user groups ie the
          Diagnostic labs and the Blood banks
          to decrease cost of production and increase their market segment.
          All thought the tests to be done remain the same the process and frequeny of the test at both the
          settlements are different, hence i had design the User - Flow in a modular yet simple way to give
          the best user experience to any kinf of user.
