        <h2>About the project</h2>
        <p>LearnVectors is a E-Learning platform, that aims at providing educational content to the tier 3 students in
          India. Their content is focused on the students apiring to prepare for the competetive
          examinations in the fields of engineering, medical and completion of their primary higher education.
          After the pandemic there has been a sharp increase in online education, we have seen alot of companies invest
          and increase their online presence. Although there have been alot of new companies coming up, most of these
          companies target the tier 1 and tier 2 students. By targeting tier 3 students LearnVectors learns its niche.
          As per the statistics prier to 2020, at an average 7 lakh students appear for there examinations and 35% of
          these students come from tier 3. In order to make it affordable for the students/families the content availabe
          to them is broken down till specific chapters can also be purchased.
          To increase the reach to the target audience we also provide them with limited free data to get acustomed and
          used to the platform. It also includes previous year paper, doubt solving session and animated video content
          with experienced teachers explaining concepts.
          <br>
          <br>
          I was bought onto the project to consult on the interface that the team had initially developed on their own
          as best as they could with their knowledge of aesthetics and usability, but as this was done more intuitively
          rather than data based. I provided the with clearer road map and organised data driven structure to Redesign
          the application.
          I spent alot of time speaking with and understadning the vision of the company its USPâ€™s, product offerings
          etc before i could plan ahead. I applied principles of Usability Principles and Heuristic Analysis, in order
          to begin my Design Process.
          Pain points like : Navigation, Identification of courses, Understanding and prioritising tasks,
          Decreasing confusion and visual overload , were my major problems areas.

        <h2>In Rectrospect</h2>
        <p>Biosense Technologies Pvt Ltd, develops diagnostic medical devices. They have developed a QPCR
          machine or a CoVid testing machine which has a 10.4 inch display.

          These machine is used by diagonostic labs and blood banks to do their respective tests. Even though
          the internal system is 100% accurate they still required a Usable and User-Friendly interaction with
          the machine in order to achieve the tasks with ease and accuracy.

          This machine is in high demand due to the current pademic situaton hence it was atmost importance
          for the machine to be extremely user-friendly.
          <br>
          <br>
          As an designer i was tasked with creating the user flow and the visual design of the machine to
          achieve ease of use and accuracy.

          As per the marketing team a single machine was to cater to two different user groups ie the
          Diagnostic labs and the Blood banks
          to decrease cost of production and increase their market segment.

          All thought the tests to be done remain the same the process and frequeny of the test at both the
          settlements are different, hence i had design the User - Flow in a modular yet simple way to give
          the best user experience to any kinf of user.
