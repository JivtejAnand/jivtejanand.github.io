				<h2>About the project</h2>
				<p>Biosense Technologies Pvt Ltd, develops diagnostic medical devices. QPCR is a diagnostic medical
					devices. It is a machine that is used to detect different viruses present in a human body.
					This machine is used by diagonostic labs and blood banks to do their respective tests. Even though
					the internal system is 100% accurate they still required a Usable and User-Friendly interaction with
					the machine in order to achieve the tasks with ease and accuracy.
					QPCR is in high demand due to the pademic situaton experienced, hence it was atmost importance
					for the machine to be extremely user-friendly.
					<br>
					<br>
					As an designer i was tasked with creating the user flow and the visual design of the machine to
					achieve ease of use and accuracy.
					As per the marketing team a single machine was to cater to two different user groups ie the
					Diagnostic labs and the Blood banks
					to decrease cost of production and increase their market segment.
					All thought the tests to be done remain the same the process and frequeny of the test at both the
					settlements are different, hence i had design the User - Flow in a modular yet simple way to give
					the best user experience to any kinf of user.
