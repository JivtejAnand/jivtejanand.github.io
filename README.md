Mark, hello, and thanks. It was my first time trying to build a website or online pages. A very knowledgeable experience, indeed. I went through a numerous number of youtube tutorials and long long sessions with my peers in order to understand and bridge the gap between making a figma layout and then implementing it into an actual coded design. The final output is very close to what I had envisioned initially so I'm really happy and glad about the website. Although in time I want to learn more javascript to be able to include much better interactions. I started building the website in figma and deciding to which projects I should include, after creating the basic layout I started to code the HTML, following which I coded the CSS and finally some javascript. I faced a lot of glitches and roadblocks but from help here and there I managed to figure my way out. In hindsight I do feel confident about writing html and css and to practise more web development projects. Web development was something i was looking forward to learn in this course and now i've a portfolio that i can show people and tell them that i've have written its code myself. Thank you.
