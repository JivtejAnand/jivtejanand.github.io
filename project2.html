        <h2>About the project</h2>
        <p>LearnVectors is a E-Learning platform, that aims at providing educational content to the tier 3 students in
          India. Their content is focused on the students apiring to prepare for the competetive
          examinations in the fields of engineering, medical and completion of their primary higher education.
          After the pandemic there has been a sharp increase in online education, we have seen alot of companies invest
          and increase their online presence. Although there have been alot of new companies coming up, most of these
          companies target the tier 1 and tier 2 students. By targeting tier 3 students LearnVectors learns its niche.
          As per the statistics prier to 2020, at an average 7 lakh students appear for there examinations and 35% of
          these students come from tier 3. In order to make it affordable for the students/families the content availabe
          to them is broken down till specific chapters can also be purchased.
          To increase the reach to the target audience we also provide them with limited free data to get acustomed and
          used to the platform. It also includes previous year paper, doubt solving session and animated video content
          with experienced teachers explaining concepts.

          I was bought onto the project to consult on the interface that the team had initially developed on their own
          as best as they could with their knowledge of aesthetics and usability, but as this was done more intuitively
          rather than data based. I provided the with clearer road map and organised data driven structure to Redesign
          the application.
          I spent alot of time speaking with and understadning the vision of the company its USPâ€™s, product offerings
          etc before i could plan ahead. I applied principles of Usability Principles and Heuristic Analysis, in order
          to begin my Design Process.
          Pain points like : Navigation, Identification of courses, Understanding and prioritising tasks,
          Decreasing confusion and visual overload , were my major problems areas.

        <h2>In Retrospect</h2>
        <p>LearnVector was a completely different project as compared to Amplichain, even the domains for the two were
          completely different. Moving from a diagnostic field to the field of education. Although learning from the
          latter helped me alot. I got the opportunity of working on Learnvectors due to my performance on Amplichain.
          With a new project there were newer challenges and as a designer I was ready to face them all. I was brought
          onto the project as a consultant for the user experience design of the product, they already had created a
          base design and were in the development phase when I was involved. My first challenge was to do a thorough
          analysis of the recent design and solve the problems arising in it and to fix them in the most aesthetic and
          least time consuming way. Due to the style of the product and the amount of information it held it was
          important to segregate all the data into different streams. It was utmost necessary to create user flows that
          were less straining to the cognitive load of the user and also had the least learning curve. Once again due to
          team effort I was able to complete this project and is currently available in the android play store.
