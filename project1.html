				<h2>About the project</h2>
				<p>Biosense Technologies Pvt Ltd, develops diagnostic medical devices. QPCR is a diagnostic medical
					devices. It is a machine that is used to detect different viruses present in a human body.
					This machine is used by diagonostic labs and blood banks to do their respective tests. Even though
					the internal system is 100% accurate they still required a Usable and User-Friendly interaction with
					the machine in order to achieve the tasks with ease and accuracy.
					QPCR is in high demand due to the pademic situaton experienced, hence it was atmost importance
					for the machine to be extremely user-friendly.
					<br>
					<br>
					As an designer i was tasked with creating the user flow and the visual design of the machine to
					achieve ease of use and accuracy.
					As per the marketing team a single machine was to cater to two different user groups ie the
					Diagnostic labs and the Blood banks
					to decrease cost of production and increase their market segment.
					All thought the tests to be done remain the same the process and frequeny of the test at both the
					settlements are different, hence i had design the User - Flow in a modular yet simple way to give
					the best user experience to any kinf of user.

				<h2>In Retrospect</h2>
				<p>Amplichain was the first project that I was assigned after joining Biosense technologies. This was
					also the project that helped me step into the vast world of user experience design. I began with
					interviewing the people that knew how the machine worked and how it would be interacted with in real
					life and by whom. It was important for me to understand the workings of the machine in order to
					understand the task flows and working procedure. Even though I wouldn't ever run the machine to run
					actual tests I had to transform myself into someone who would in order to gain insights as the
					resources were scarce and the timeline strict. I had to be extremely aware of the work I was doing
					and the quality of it in order to impress my superiors and prove myself in order to excel and get
					more opportunities in the near future. The learning from this project are the ones that I will carry
					with myself throughout my career. Iâ€™m really thankful to my superiors for their help and support
					throughout the project and also to the development team who was able to transform the figma
					prototype into an actual working prototype. I strongly believe it was a team effort that brought
					this project to its best end.
